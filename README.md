## Installation Steps

Ah, got it! You want to **run only the frontend (React) part of a MERN stack** but use **Firebase** instead of the backend server for things like authentication or database. Hereâ€™s how to do it step by step:

---

## ðŸ”¹ Steps to Run MERN Frontend with Firebase

### 1. Go to Your Frontend Folder

If your React frontend is in a separate folder (commonly `client`):

```bash
cd client
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have all frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Install Firebase SDK if not already installed:

```bash
npm install firebase
```

---

### 3. Setup Firebase

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a project.
2. Create a **Web App** in your project and copy the Firebase config:
3. Replace all backend calls (like REST API requests) with Firebase Auth, Firestore, or Realtime Database.

---

### 4. Run the Frontend

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React app at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

### 5. Optional: Connect to Firebase Auth/Firestore

* For **Authentication**, use `auth` from Firebase.
* For **Database**, use `db` from Firestore.
* Remove any server API calls if you want to run purely frontend with Firebase.

---

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** You can host the React app on **Firebase Hosting** too:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init
firebase deploy
```
